## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A subdued blue (#5F9EA0) that evokes professionalism, clarity, and a sense of calm.
- Background color: A very light, desaturated version of the primary (#F0F8FF). This will give a clean background without distracting from the content.
- Accent color: A more vibrant green (#90EE90), is used for interactive elements and highlights. This provides a clear visual distinction for calls to action.
- Body text: 'Inter', a sans-serif font providing a modern, clean, and highly readable aesthetic.
- Headline text: 'Space Grotesk', a geometric sans-serif which matches well with 'Inter', to add a bit of visual interest, while maintaining great legibility.
- Simple, clean icons for resume sections to improve visual structure.
- Clean and intuitive drag-and-drop interface for easy reordering of sections.
